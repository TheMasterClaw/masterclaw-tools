# MasterClaw Tools 🛠️

CLI utilities, automation scripts, health checks, and maintenance tools for the MasterClaw ecosystem.

## Installation

```bash
# Clone
git clone https://github.com/TheMasterClaw/masterclaw-tools.git
cd masterclaw-tools

# Install globally
npm install -g .

# Or run with npx
npx .
```

## Commands

### `mc health`
Comprehensive health monitoring with multiple modes
```bash
mc health                      # Quick health check
mc health --watch              # Continuous monitoring (refresh every 5s)
mc health --notify             # Desktop notifications on status changes
mc health --compact            # Cron-friendly output (exits 1 on failure)
```

Checks performed:
- HTTP endpoint health (Interface, Backend, Core, Gateway)
- Docker container status
- SSL certificate expiration
- Infrastructure health checks

### `mc status`
Check health of all MasterClaw services
```bash
mc status
mc status --watch  # Continuous monitoring
```

### `mc deploy`
Zero-downtime deployment management
```bash
mc deploy rolling              # Blue-green deployment with zero downtime
mc deploy rolling --force      # Deploy even if tests fail
mc deploy canary 10            # Deploy to 10% of traffic first
mc deploy rollback             # Rollback to previous version
mc deploy status               # Show current deployment status
mc deploy history              # Show deployment history
```

### `mc logs`
Comprehensive log management and viewing
```bash
mc logs [service]              # View logs (service: traefik, interface, backend, core, gateway, chroma, watchtower, all)
mc logs backend --follow       # Follow logs in real-time
mc logs backend --lines 500    # Show last 500 lines
mc logs backend --since 1h     # Show logs from last hour
mc logs status                 # Show log sizes and rotation status
mc logs clean                  # Clean up logs to free disk space
mc logs clean --all            # Clean logs AND prune Docker system
mc logs export                 # Export all logs for troubleshooting
mc logs export backend         # Export specific service logs
mc logs export --since 24h     # Export logs from last 24 hours
mc logs search "ERROR"         # Search for pattern in all logs
mc logs search "error" backend -i  # Case-insensitive search in backend
```

**Services:** `traefik`, `interface`, `backend`, `core`, `gateway`, `chroma`, `watchtower`, or `all` (default)

### `mc backup`
Trigger manual backup
```bash
mc backup
```

### `mc config`
Manage configuration
```bash
mc config get gateway.url
mc config set gateway.url https://your-gateway.com
mc config list
```

### `mc revive`
Restart all services
```bash
mc revive
mc revive --pull  # Pull latest images first
```

### `mc update`
Check for updates
```bash
mc update
mc update --apply
```

### `mc completion`
Shell auto-completion support for bash, zsh, and fish
```bash
mc completion bash              # Print bash completion script
mc completion bash --install    # Install bash completion
mc completion zsh --install     # Install zsh completion
mc completion fish --install    # Install fish completion
mc completion status            # Check completion installation status
```

**Features:**
- Auto-detects your shell if not specified
- Completes commands, subcommands, and flags
- Service name completion for `mc logs`
- Smart file completion for restore commands
- Install to standard shell directories automatically

**Manual Installation:**
```bash
# Bash
mc completion bash --print >> ~/.bashrc

# Zsh
mc completion zsh --print > ~/.zsh/completions/_mc

# Fish
mc completion fish --print > ~/.config/fish/completions/mc.fish
```

## Deployment Strategy

The `mc deploy` command implements **blue-green deployment** for zero-downtime updates:

1. **Blue-Green**: Two identical production environments (blue and green)
2. **Zero Downtime**: Traffic switches instantly after health checks pass
3. **Automatic Rollback**: One-command rollback to previous version
4. **Canary Support**: Route percentage of traffic to new version first
5. **Health Checks**: Services must pass 3 consecutive health checks before switch

### How It Works

```
Current State:     Blue (active) ← Traffic
                   Green (idle)

Deploy:            Blue (active) ← Traffic
                   Green (deploying + health checks)

Switch Traffic:    Blue (idle)
                   Green (active) ← Traffic

Cleanup:           Blue (stopped)
                   Green (active) ← Traffic
```

## Configuration

Config is stored in `~/.masterclaw/config.json`:

```json
{
  "infraDir": "/path/to/infrastructure",
  "gateway": {
    "url": "http://localhost:3000",
    "token": null
  },
  "api": {
    "url": "http://localhost:3001"
  }
}
```

## Library

The CLI uses these modules:
- `lib/services.js` - Service health checking
- `lib/config.js` - Configuration management with security
- `lib/docker.js` - Docker Compose helpers
